class Remedian():
    """Remedian object for a robust averaging method for large data sets.

    Implementation of the Remedian algorithm, see [1]_ [2]_ [3]_ for
    references. This algorithm is used to approximate the median of several
    data chunks if these data chunks cannot (or should not) be loaded into
    memory at once. See "Notes" section for further information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_size : ndarray
        The shape of each data chunk (=observation) to be fed into the Remedian
        object.
    n_obs : int
        The number of observations to be stored within each array.
        If `n_obs` >= `t`, Remedian will equal the median. The smaller this
        parameter, the fewer data have to be loaded into memory at once, but
        the less accurate the approximation of the median will be.
    t : int
        The total number of observations from which a median should be
        approximated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    obs_count : int
        Counter of number of observations that have already been given
        to the Remedian object.
    remedian : None | ndarray, shape(obs_size)
        The calculated remedian of the same shape as the input data.
        Will be None until all observations `n_obs` have been fed into
        the object using the add_obs method.

    Notes
    -----
    Given a data chunk of size `obs_size`, and `t` data chunks overall, the
    Remedian class sets up a number `k_arrs` of arrays of length `n_obs`.

    The median of the `t` data chunks of size `obs_size` is then approximated
    as follows: One data chunk after another is fed into the `n_obs` positions
    of the first array. When the first array is full, its median is calculated
    and stored in the first position of the second array. After this, the first
    array is re-used to fill the second position of the second array, etc.
    When the second array is full, the median of its values is stored in the
    first position of the third array, and so on.

    The final "Remedian" is the median of the last array, after all `t` data
    chunks have been fed into the object.

    In other words, given an n-dimensional array, the Remedian class
    approximates the median of this array across the ith dimension and you have
    to break up your n-dimensional array into `t` n-1-dimensional arrays that
    are given to Remedian one after another.
