class Remedian():
    """Remedian object for a robust averaging method for large data sets.

    Implementation of the Remedian algorithm, see [1] [2] [3] for references.

    This algorithm is used to approximate the median of several data chunks if
    these data chunks cannot (or should not) be loaded into memory at once.

    Given a data chunk of size `obs_size`, and `t` data chunks overall, the
    Remedian class sets up a number `k_arrs` of arrays of length `n_obs`.

    The median of the `t` data chunks of size `obs_size` is then approximated
    as follows: One data chunk after another is fed into the `n_obs` positions
    of the first array. When the first array is full, its median is calculated
    and stored in the first position of the second array. After this, the first
    array is re-used to fill the second position of the second array, etc.
    When the second array is full, the median of its values is stored in the
    first position of the third array, and so on.

    The final "Remedian" is the median of the last array, after all `t` data
    chunks have been fed into the object.


    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_size : ndarray
        The shape of each data chunk (=observation) to be fed into the Remedian
        object.

    n_obs : int
        The number of observations to be stored within each array.
        If `n_obs` >= `t`, Remedian will equal the median.

    t : int
        The total number of observations from which a median should be
        approximated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    obs_count : int
        Counter of number of observations that have already been given
        to the Remedian object.

    remedian : None | ndarray, shape(obs_size)
        The calculated remedian of the same shape as the input data.
        Will be None until all observations `n_obs` have been fed into
        the object using the add_obs method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from remedian.remedian import Remedian

    >>> # We can have data of any shape ... e.g., 3D:
    >>> data_shape = (2,3,4)

    >>> # Now we have to decide how many data observations we want to load into
    >>> # memory at a time before computing a first intermediate median from it
    >>> n_obs = 100

    >>> # Pick some example number, assume we have `t` arrays of `data_shape`
    >>> # that we want to summarize with Remedian
    >>> t = 500

    >>> # Initialize the object
    >>> r = Remedian(data_shape, n_obs, t)

    >>> # Feed it the data- For now, we just generate the data randomly.
    >>> for obs_i in range(t):
    >>>     obs = np.random.random(data_shape)
    >>>     r.add_obs(obs)

    >>> # This is the remedian
    >>> r.remedian
